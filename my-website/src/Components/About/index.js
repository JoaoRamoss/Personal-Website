            <Content>
            I graduated in Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho, where I learned important concepts such as software development, 
            data structures and algorithms, amongst other fundamentals. I'm also currently a Master's degree student in the same field, 
            where I'm exploring the topics of Software Development, Validation and Maintenance, and Graphical Computing.<br/>
            I enjoy being challenged and often seek opportunities to expand my skills and step outside of my comfort zone.
